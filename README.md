# DFIR Splunk Dashboards Repository
## Overview
This repository contains pre-built, battle-tested Splunk dashboards in *.xml* format, designed for Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) analysts. These dashboards help automate the analysis of collected logs, EVTX files, CSV data, Plaso timelines, and other forensic artifacts ingested into Splunk Enterprise.

Simply upload your case data into Splunk, select the relevant index/case from a dropdown menu, and let the dashboards perform automated analysis to accelerate investigations.
